# Algorithms-for-Sequence-Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for implementing various algorithms for sequence analysis.

## Requirements
The scripts in this repository require Python 3.6 or higher, as well as the following libraries:

numpy
scipy

## List of Algorithms
The following algorithms are included in this repository:

- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** - This algorithm takes in two sequences and finds the longest subsequence that is common to both sequences.

- **Smith-Waterman Algorithm** - This algorithm is used for local sequence alignment, and takes in two sequences as well as a scoring matrix and gap penalty. It returns the optimal alignment of the two sequences based on the given parameters.

- **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm** - This algorithm is used for global sequence alignment, and also takes in two sequences and a scoring matrix and gap penalty. It returns the optimal alignment of the two sequences based on the given parameters.
